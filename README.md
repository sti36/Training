▌  Solving the problems of completed courses

This repository contains my solutions to the tasks completed in various educational courses. Practical tasks covering different areas of programming and technology are presented here.

▌  Repository structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each course has its own separate folder.
- Inside each folder there are files with solutions to problems.
- The files are named according to the task number or the topic name of the lesson.

▌  How do I use the repository?

To get acquainted with my solutions:

1. Go to the appropriate directory of the corresponding course.
2. Open the solution file you are interested in.
3. Study the code and comments explaining the course of my thoughts and the solution to the problem.

To run any solution, you will need an appropriate development environment and an installed programming language interpreter.
